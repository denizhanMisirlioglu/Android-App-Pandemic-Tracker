# Pandemic-Tracker
My first android project (04.2022).
I started to learn android app development with this project.
Android App for tracking and comparing intercontinental Covid - 19 statistics.

In my android app project, I used Kotlin for the programming language and XML for the UI.
For data mining, I wrote a script in Python that retrieves the current COVID-19 data from OurWorldInData website every time it runs.
After converting the extracted CSV data to JSON format using Python, I transferred it to my Firebase database.

I connected my Firebase database to my Android app and completed the application using various practices such as RecyclerView,
onClick, table and graph display, toast messages, sorting algorithms, intent for data transfer between activities, and image buttons.
